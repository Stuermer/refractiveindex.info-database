<h1>N,N-Dimethylformamide, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NO (DMF)</h1>

N,N-Dimethylformamide (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NO, DMF) is a colorless, high boiling point, polar aprotic solvent with a faint amine-like odor. It is widely used in organic synthesis and industrial applications due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of compounds. DMF is commonly employed in the production of acrylic fibers, plastics, pesticides, and as a solvent in peptide coupling for pharmaceuticals. It is miscible with water and most organic liquids, making it a versatile solvent in chemical reactions and processes.
