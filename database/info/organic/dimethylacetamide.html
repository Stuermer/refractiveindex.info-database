<h1>N,N-Dimethylacetamide, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO (DMA, DMAc)</h1>

N,N-Dimethylacetamide (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO, DMA, DMAc) is a colorless, high boiling point, polar aprotic solvent with a faint amine-like odor. It is widely used in organic synthesis and industrial applications due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of polymers and resins. DMAc is commonly employed in the production of acrylic fibers, plastics, films, coatings, and in the spinning of polyurethane-based fibers. It is miscible with water and most organic solvents, making it a versatile solvent in chemical reactions and processes.
