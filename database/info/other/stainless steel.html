<h1>Stainless Steel</h1>

Stainless steel is a family of iron-based alloys known for their corrosion resistance and high strength. The key characteristic of stainless steel is the presence of at least 10.5% chromium, which forms a passive layer of chromium oxide on the surface, preventing further corrosion. Stainless steels are widely used in various industries, including construction, automotive, medical devices, and kitchenware, due to their durability and aesthetic appeal.

There are several types of stainless steel, with austenitic, ferritic, and martensitic being the primary categories.


<h2>Types of Stainless Steel</h2>


<h3>Austenitic Stainless Steel</h3>

Austenitic stainless steels are the most widely used category, comprising approximately 70% of all stainless steel production. They are characterized by their face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which provides excellent formability and weldability. Austenitic stainless steels are non-magnetic and have high levels of nickel and chromium.

<p>
Common Grades:
<ul>
  <li><strong>304 Stainless Steel:</strong> Contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel.</li>
  <li><strong>316 Stainless Steel:</strong> Contains added molybdenum for enhanced corrosion resistance.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Typical composition (304 Stainless Steel):
<ul>
  <li>Chromium (Cr): 18–20%</li>
  <li>Nickel (Ni): 8–10.5%</li>
  <li>Carbon (C): ≤ 0.08%</li>
  <li>Manganese (Mn): ≤ 2%</li>
  <li>Silicon (Si): ≤ 1%</li>
  <li>Phosphorus (P): ≤ 0.045%</li>
  <li>Sulfur (S): ≤ 0.03%</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Ferritic Stainless Steel</h3>

Ferritic stainless steels are characterized by their body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. They are magnetic and contain chromium ranging from 10.5% to 27%, with little to no nickel content. Ferritic stainless steels offer good corrosion resistance and are less expensive than austenitic grades due to the lower nickel content.

<p>
Common Grades:
<ul>
  <li><strong>430 Stainless Steel:</strong> Contains approximately 17% chromium.</li>
  <li><strong>409 Stainless Steel:</strong> Contains approximately 11% chromium and is commonly used in automotive exhaust systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Typical composition (Stainless Steel 430):</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Chromium (Cr): 16–18%</li>
  <li>Carbon (C): ≤ 0.12%</li>
  <li>Manganese (Mn): ≤ 1%</li>
  <li>Silicon (Si): ≤ 1%</li>
  <li>Phosphorus (P): ≤ 0.04%</li>
  <li>Sulfur (S): ≤ 0.03%</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Martensitic Stainless Steel</h3>

Martensitic stainless steels are known for their high strength and hardness due to their martensitic crystal structure. They are magnetic and typically contain 11.5% to 18% chromium with varying amounts of carbon. Martensitic steels can be heat-treated to improve their mechanical properties and are commonly used in applications requiring high strength and moderate corrosion resistance.

<p>
Common Grades:
<ul>
  <li><strong>410 Stainless Steel:</strong> Contains approximately 12% chromium and is used in cutlery and steam turbine blades.</li>
  <li><strong>420 Stainless Steel:</strong> Contains higher carbon content for increased hardness; used in surgical instruments and knife blades.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Typical composition (Stainless Steel 410):</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Chromium (Cr): 11.5–13.5%</li>
  <li>Carbon (C): ≤ 0.15%</li>
  <li>Manganese (Mn): ≤ 1%</li>
  <li>Silicon (Si): ≤ 1%</li>
  <li>Phosphorus (P): ≤ 0.04%</li>
  <li>Sulfur (S): ≤ 0.03%</li>
</ul>
